# medical_landmark_detection_denoising

This project is part of my research on medical landmark detection.
In this part, I use self-supervised learning to get some information in my whole project.
Because of the privacy on the whole project, I cannot publicize the other parts.

In this project, I implemented an auto-encoder model with the ability of:
1- Denoising whole the image
2- Denoising the central part of the patched-based version
3- Reconstructing the central part of the patched-based version

To run this project you only need to set your settings in config file.
